- **Title:** <!-- a short title -->
- **Date:** <!-- when it was proposed (use YYYY-MM-DD format) -->

### Summary

<!-- A short explanation of the proposal. -->

### Decision

<!-- A place to briefly mention "how" the decision was made, when, and/or who signed it off. -->

---

### Context

<!--
- motivation
 - why are we doing this; what issue(s) are we solving?
 - why is this important?
  - functional and non-functional drivers
- the current state
  - prior work
  - what is the impact of not doing this?
-->

### Proposal

<!-- This section explains the solution and outlines the scope of work.

- describe the proposed solution in more detail, including relevant technical details
- how will we verify that the proposal is working correctly?
- what monitoring and alarms will be developed to allow us to respond to
  problems?
-->

### Unresolved questions

<!-- Questions and/or unknowns left to be refined and resolved over RFC's lifetime.

By the time the RFC is ready for merging, this section should be empty and its conclusions moved to some of the other sections. -->

### Implications and considerations

<!--
- drawbacks: why should we _not_ do this?
- how does it impact other teams (security, devops, data,...)
-->

### Rationale and alternatives

<!--
- why is this the best solution?
- what other solutions have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
-->

### Future possibilities

<!-- Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides additional information. -->

### Updates

<!-- If, during implementation, there are any substantial changes or alterations
to the plan, please record them here. -->
